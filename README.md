# React.js Profile Card

This mini project was made with React and CSS as part of Scrimba's first React project.

# Building

Throughout the building of this project, Brad Traversy's React Crash Course was an invaluable resource and referred back to it several times.

#### Learning ####
Through this project I was better able to understand...

* basic implementation of useState hook, syntax for defining the current state and its accompanying function
* props and their usage and how they can be used to customize certain properties of the same type of component
